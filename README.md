# MEAN Stack Sample !

Hello, this repository the result of follow along coding from Udemy course [Angular & NodeJS - The MEAN Stack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-131a1ebe-d8c7-451b-82c5-0eee4e0ae72d/), all copyrights are reserved to Udemy and the author (Maximilian Schwarzmuller).


## Scope and Purpose

The scope of this project is starting from preparation and deployment of the app ( Backend and Frontend ).
I chose this project, so that I can learn the best practice of building backend service using Node.js and front end app using Angular.js

## Stacks Used

As the title MEAN this project is using : 
- MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as modeling helper
- Express as the api middleware
- Angular as the frontend
- Node.js as the backend 

## How to use
Use terminal and navigate to main folder.
To start install the dependencies run this script :
> npm install

Backend will be deployed to localhost:3000, to run backend service run this script : 
> npm run start:server

Angular web service will be deployed to localhost:4200, to run it open new terminal and use this script : 
> ng serve
